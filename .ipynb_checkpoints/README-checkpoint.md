## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

   From this analytics project, we hope that we will be able to recognize how different variables can affect a wine's quality. With our analytics project, we hope that in the near future, we will be able to recognize what is considered as a bad or good quality wine. We are interested in this dataset mainly due to our passion and love for wine.Wine has so many different notes and texture that every bottle is unique in its own sense, and by doing this analytics project, we will be able to further improve our knowledge on wine. One question the group would like to explore is how different combinations of different variables work well together to create a good quality wine. We would also like to explore which variable has the biggest impact on the overall wine quality. Yes we believe we can build a dashboard for this project once we study and understand the data, but as of this moment, we are unsure as to what will be put into the dashboard.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

The dataset is provided by the University of Minho in Portugal and the research was done by Paulo Cortez. The research was about the quality of wine based on physicochemical tests with 11 inputs including, fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, and alcohol; and with one output variable: quality with a score between 0 and 10. The data was collected in 2009. The data was collected in 2009 from the red and white Vinho Verde wine samples in the north of Portugal. The purpose of the dataset is to improve wine production for consumers through physiochemical attributes and factors. Furthermore, since the goal is to improve wine quality and taste preferences for consumers, the area covered by the research is for business.  The dataset is multivariate and during the research, regression techniques were used to achieve promising results.
